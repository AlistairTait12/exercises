# > Given a list of tweets,
# > Replace each negative word in that tweet for the word CENSORED

# Take a tweet, split the tweet, if it matches a censored word,
# replace as above. Reprint the tweet

# Areas for improvement: 
# > Does not censor words preceeded/followed by
#   punctuation/ othere special characters.
# > Should also be case insensitive
